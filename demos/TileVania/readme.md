# TileVania Demo

Uses the following Unity plugins:

- [Unity 2d-extras](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/2d-extras)
- Cinemachine package

In particular the former has been used for tiles with rulesets.
However the contents of the package have themselves been [ignored](Packages/.gitignore)
so will require reimporting for builds to function.
