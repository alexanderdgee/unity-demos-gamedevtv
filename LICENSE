Note that the source in this repository is contained under a variety of licenses.

To the best of my knowledge, most of it is MIT licensed under one of the copyrights listed below.

Assets should all either be in the public domain, or available under CC[0]. However, as most of the assets have again been provided by GameDev.tv, I cannot be sure of this. (The courses do not specify this.)

Some of the code is written by me. Those parts not taken from the GameDev.tv courses are kept under copyright.

Since I cannot guarantee licensing, I suggest you go and investigate the GameDev.tv courses directly for yourself if interested.

If there is anything in this repo that has been incorrectly labelled, please open an issue and I shall endeavor to remedy the situation.
